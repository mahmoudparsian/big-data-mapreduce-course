# Big Data Modeling & Analytics

## Course Description:

~~~
This course is about big data and its role in  carrying 
out modern business intelligence for actionable insight 
to address new business needs. This course is a lab-led 
and open source software rooted  course.  Students will 
learn the  fundamentals  of MapReduce, Spark framework, 
NoSQL databases, PySpark, and Amazon Athena. The  class 
will  focus  on  the storage, processing,  and analysis
aspects of  big data.  Students will use  Spark cluster 
and MapReduce fundamentals to solve big data  problems.
