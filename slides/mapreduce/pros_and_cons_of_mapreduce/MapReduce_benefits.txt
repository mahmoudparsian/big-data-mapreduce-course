Advantages of Hadoop MapReduce Programming

Formalize MapReduce:

Let [...] denotes a list of objects

map(k, v) -> [(k2, v2)]
reduce(k2, [v2]) -> [(k3, v3)]


what does MapReduce offer:

MapReduce programming offers several benefits 
to help you gain valuable insights from your 
big data:

Scalability. Businesses can process petabytes 
             of data stored in the Hadoop Distributed 
             File System (HDFS).
             
Flexibility. Hadoop enables easier access to multiple 
             sources of data and multiple types of data.
             
Speed. With parallel processing and minimal data movement, 
       Hadoop offers fast processing of massive amounts 
       of data.
       
Simple. Developers can write code in a choice of languages, 
        including Java, C++ and Python.
        
Fault Tolerance: Given that you have a replication for your
                 cluster, your MR job will complete if even
                 some of the nodes crash/die
