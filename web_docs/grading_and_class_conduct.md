## Course Policies

### General

* Quizzes and exams are closed book, closed notes

* No makeup quizzes or exams will be given

* Grades in the C range represent performance 
  that meets expectations
  
* Grades in the B range represent performance 
  that is substantially better than the expectations
  
* Grades in the A range represent work that 
  is excellent

* Grades will be maintained in the Camino 
  course shell.  Students are responsible 
  for tracking their progress by referring 
  to the online gradebook.

### Labs and Assignments

* Students are expected to work independently. 

* Offering and accepting solutions from others 
  is an act of plagiarism, which is a serious 
  offense and all involved parties will be 
  penalized according to the SCU Academic 
  Honesty Policy.

* Discussion amongst students is encouraged, 
  but when in doubt, direct your questions 
  to the professor.

* No late assignments will be accepted under 
  any circumstances

### Attendance and Absences

* Attendance is expected.

* Students are responsible for all missed work, 
  regardless of the reason for absence.
  
* It is also the absentee's responsibility 
  to get all missing notes or materials.


### Instructor's Intended Purpose

* The student's work must match the instructor's 
  intended purpose for an assignment.  While the 
  instructor will establish the intent of an assignment, 
  each student must clarify outstanding questions of 
  that intent for a given assignment.

* The student may not give or get any unauthorized or 
  excessive assistance in the preparation of any work.

### Authorship of a work

1. **The student must clearly establish authorship of a work.** 

2. Referenced work must be clearly documented, cited, and 
  attributed, regardless of media or distribution.
