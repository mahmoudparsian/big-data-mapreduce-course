## Course Policies

General
-------

* Quizzes and exams are closed book, closed notes
* No makeup quizzes or exams will be given
* Grades in the C range represent performance that meets expectations
* Grades in the B range represent performance that is substantially better
  than the expectations
* Grades in the A range represent work that is excellent
* Grades will be maintained in the LMS course shell. Students are responsible for tracking
  their progress by referring to the online gradebook.

Labs and Assignments
--------------------

* Students are expected to work independently. Offering} and accepting
  solutions from others is an act of plagiarism, which is a serious offense 
  and all involved parties will be penalized according to the Academic 
  Honesty Policy

* Discussion amongst students is encouraged, but when in doubt, direct your 
  questions to the professor.

* No late assignments will be accepted under any circumstances

Attendance and Absences
-----------------------

* Attendance is expected.
* Students are responsible for all missed work, regardless of the reason for absence.
* It is also the absentee's responsibility to get all missing notes or materials.


Instructor's Intended Purpose
------------------------------

* The student's work must match the instructor's intended purpose for 
  an assignment.  While the instructor will establish the intent of an 
  assignment, each student must clarify outstanding questions of that 
  intent for a given assignment.

* The student may not give or get any unauthorized or excessive assistance 
  in the preparation of any work.

* The student must clearly establish authorship of a work. Referenced work must
be clearly documented, cited, and attributed, regardless of media or distribution.


## Tentative Course Outline
