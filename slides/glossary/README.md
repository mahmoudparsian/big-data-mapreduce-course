# Glossary of Big Data, MapReduce, Spark

* Compiled and edited by: Mahmoud Parsian

* Last updated: 2/23/2023

* This glossary is written for my students taking 
[Big Data Modeling & Analytics](https://github.com/mahmoudparsian/big-data-mapreduce-course) 
at [Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu).

* This is not a regular glossary: it is a detailed glossary 
  for my students to learn basics of key terms in big data, 
  MapReduce, and PySpark (Python API for Apache Spark).
