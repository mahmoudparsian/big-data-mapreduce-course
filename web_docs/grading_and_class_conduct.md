## Course Policies

### General

* Quizzes and exams are closed book, closed notes
* No makeup quizzes or exams will be given
* Grades in the C range represent performance that meets expectations
* Grades in the B range represent performance that is substantially better
  than the expectations
* Grades in the A range represent work that is excellent
* Grades will be maintained in the LMS course shell. Students 
  are responsible for tracking their progress by referring to 
  the online gradebook.

### Labs and Assignments

* Students are expected to work independently. 
* Offering and accepting solutions from others 
  is an act of plagiarism, which is a serious offense 
  and all involved parties will be penalized according 
  to the Academic Honesty Policy

* Discussion amongst students is encouraged, but when 
  in doubt, direct your questions to the professor.

* No late assignments will be accepted under any circumstances

### Attendance and Absences

* Attendance is expected.
* Students are responsible for all missed work, 
  regardless of the reason for absence.
* It is also the absentee's responsibility to 
  get all missing notes or materials.


### Instructor's Intended Purpose

* The student's work must match the instructor's intended 
  purpose for an assignment.  While the instructor will 
  establish the intent of an assignment, each student must 
  clarify outstanding questions of that intent for a 
  given assignment.

* The student may not give or get any unauthorized or 
  excessive assistance in the preparation of any work.

* The student must clearly establish authorship of a work. 
  Referenced work must be clearly documented, cited, and 
  attributed, regardless of media or distribution.
